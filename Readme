## Overview
This project aims to extract, transform, and visualize data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository, providing valuable insights and information in an interactive and visually appealing manner through a live geo visualization dashboard. The data is stored in a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.

## Features
- Data extraction from Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository
- Data transformation and cleaning using Python and Pandas
- Insertion of transformed data into MySQL database
- Creation of live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly
- Dashboard includes multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures
- Secure, efficient, and user-friendly solution

## Approach
1. **Data Extraction**: Cloning the GitHub repository using scripting to fetch the data.
2. **Data Transformation**: Pre-processing and cleaning the data using Python and Pandas.
3. **Database Insertion**: Storing the transformed data in a MySQL database using "mysql-connector-python".
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Building an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.
5. **Data Retrieval**: Fetching data from the MySQL database into Pandas dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.
6. **Deployment**: Testing and deploying the solution publicly for easy access.
